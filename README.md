# Personal Recipe Book

### Background
In an attempt to declutter my bookshelves, I am getting rid of any recipe book I don't reference regularly. However, the few recipes I use/am interested in trying, I am going to attempt to digitise them into an online recipe book so they can be donated, safe in the knowledge that a potenital recipe gem will not be lost.

As it is difficult to choose a best method of cetegorising recipes, I will implement a tag and search system. Compulsary tags will include source and meal type.

Eventually, some form of storage will need to be implemented but for the initial proof of concept I will store them locally in JSON format. I have chosen this as I plan to use a NoSQL database to store the recipes. This should make the migration simpler and help design the structure the data will be stored.

### Reference Resources
I will use the two below resources as reference materials but aim to build this mostly without guidance.
